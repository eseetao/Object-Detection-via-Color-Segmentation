# Barrel Detector Project

3 Files are attached in this project:

barrel_logistic_regression.py
Dataloader.py
barrel_detector.py


The Dataloader.py contains the roipoly implementation and function to pickle the obtained masks from the training set images.
The barrel_logistic_regression.py contains the logistic regression class and the functions necessary to train and test the model as well as the necessary unpicking function to read the pickled mask images and “YUV” image color channels. 
Finally, the barrel_detector.py contains the final submission for the coding part and has the segment image and bounding box functions.
